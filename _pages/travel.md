A bit of change from other part of the website. Besides doing some work in sleep and stuff, I also like to travel around the world. 

### ✈️ Favorite Places

- **Iceland** – The raw landscapes and geothermal wonders were like nowhere else I’ve been.
- **Kyoto, Japan** – A beautiful mix of tradition, nature, and peace.
- **Lisbon, Portugal** – Amazing food, vibrant street life, and rich history.
- **Taiwan (Home)** – Every visit helps me reconnect with my roots and family.

### 🧳 Travel and Research

Some of my travel overlaps with academic work — conferences, field visits, collaborations. But I also make space to wander for the sake of wandering. I believe being exposed to different cultures makes me a better thinker and communicator.
