Exploring the world has always been a big part of who I am. While my academic journey often keeps me at my desk or in the lab, traveling offers me a chance to reset, reflect, and connect with people and places beyond research.

### 🌍 Why I Travel

Travel, to me, is not just about visiting new places — it’s about perspective. It teaches patience, adaptability, and humility — all of which, in a way, feed back into how I approach my work as a researcher and educator.

### ✈️ Favorite Places

- **Iceland** – The raw landscapes and geothermal wonders were like nowhere else I’ve been.
- **Kyoto, Japan** – A beautiful mix of tradition, nature, and peace.
- **Lisbon, Portugal** – Amazing food, vibrant street life, and rich history.
- **Taiwan (Home)** – Every visit helps me reconnect with my roots and family.

### 🧳 Travel and Research

Some of my travel overlaps with academic work — conferences, field visits, collaborations. But I also make space to wander for the sake of wandering. I believe being exposed to different cultures makes me a better thinker and communicator.
