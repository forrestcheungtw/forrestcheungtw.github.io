## Hello

I’m Forrest. I'm a postdoctorial researcher in sleep medicine at the University of Oxford. I’ve always been a bit of a night owl, which probably explains how I ended up researching sleep for a living. But more than that, I’m driven by a real interest in how sleep the body’s internal clock affects mental health, especially in more vulnerable populations. I created this site as a place to share a bit about what I’m working on. <br>

Please take a look around, and feel free to get in touch if anything sparks your interest.

### Research Focus
- Adolescence mental health
- Chronotheraputics
- Shift work
- Sleep and circadian rhythem
- Sleep interventions

### Methodology
- Actigraphy
- Meta-analysis
- Polysomnography (PSG) / EEG
- Randomised control trial (RCT)

### My academic jounrey

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website’s content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub’s servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart’s content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you’ve broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you’ve given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

For those users that need more advanced functionality, the template also supports the following popular tools: - [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for mathematical equations - [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for diagraming - [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for plotting
