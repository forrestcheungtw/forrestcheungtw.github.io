Sleep and circadian rhythms shape nearly every aspect of human health — from mood and cognition to physical, mental, and social health.
My research centres on **behavioral sleep and circadian medicine**, with a focus on mechanisms and interventions for sleep disorders across the lifespan. I work at the intersection of clinical psychology, chronobiology, and public health.

## 🔬 Current Projects

<div class="project-block">
<h3>Developing a Behavioural Sleep Intervention for NHS Shift Workers</h3>
  <p>
    I’m developing and testing a behavioural intervention tailored to <strong>shift work disorder</strong> in UK NHS healthcare workers. The approach combines circadian-based strategies such as bright light therapy with behavioural techniques borrowed from CBT-I to help individuals adapt to irregular shift schedules, aiming to enhance sleep quality and overall well‑being.

<h3>Efficacy of CBT‑I with Bright Light Therapy for Youths with Insomnia and Evening Chronotype</h3>
  <p>
     This project is a randomised controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of <strong>cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT‑I)</strong>, with and without the addition of <strong>bright light therapy</strong>, in youths with insomnia and an evening chronotype. The study evaluates outcomes related to sleep, circadian characteristics, mood, and objective circadian rhythm markers (i.e., DLMO).

<h3>The Role of Circadian Characteristics in Adolescents with Insomnia</h3>
  <p>
  As part of my doctoral thesis, I investigated the circadian characteristics of <strong>delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD)</strong> and chronic insomnia in adolescents. Our findings revealed that circadian rhythm disruptions play a significant role in the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia during adolescence—particularly among individuals with evening chronotypes. The study also identified shared features between DSWPD and insomnia, shedding light on overlapping treatment targets and highlighting the potential for more integrated, chronobiologically informed interventions.
