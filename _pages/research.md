Sleep and circadian rhythms shape nearly every aspect of human health — from mood and cognition to physical, mental, and social health.
My research centres on **behavioral sleep and circadian medicine**, with a focus on mechanisms and interventions for sleep disorders across the lifespan. I work at the intersection of clinical psychology, chronobiology, and public health.

<h3>Developing a Behavioural Sleep Intervention for NHS Shift Workers</h3>
<em>at University of Oxford</em><br/>
  <hr />
  <p>
    I’m developing and testing a behavioural intervention tailored to <strong>shift work disorder</strong> in UK NHS healthcare workers. The approach combines circadian-based strategies such as bright light therpay with behavioral techniques borrowed from CBT-I to help individuals adapt to irregular shift schedules, aiming to enhance sleep quality and overall well‑being.

<h3>Efficacy of CBT‑I with Bright Light Therapy for Youths with Insomnia and Evening Chronotype</h3>
<em>at University of Hong Kong</em><br/>
  <hr />
  <p>
    We led a randomised controlled trial of <strong>cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT‑I)</strong>, with and without <strong>bright light therapy</strong>, targeting youths with insomnia and an evening chronotype. We’re evaluating outcomes on sleep, mood, and objective circadian markers.

<h3>The Role of Circadian Characteristics in Adolescents with Insomnia</h3>
<em>at University of Hong Kong</em><br/>
  <hr />
  <p>
  As part of my doctoral thesis, this work compared the circadian characteristics of <strong>delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD)</strong> and chronic insomnia in adolescents. We found that circadian rhythm disruptions play an important role in the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia in this age group, particularly in those with evening chronotypes. The findings highlight shared features between DSWPD and insomnia, offering insights into overlapping treatment targets and potential for more integrated interventions.
