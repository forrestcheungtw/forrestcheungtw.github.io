Sleep and circadian rhythms shape nearly every aspect of human health — from mood and cognition to physical, mental, and social health.
My research centres on **behavioral sleep and circadian medicine**, with a focus on mechanisms and interventions for sleep disorders across the lifespan. I work at the intersection of clinical psychology, chronobiology, and public health.

<div>
<h3>🕒 Shift Work & Circadian Disruption</h3>
<p><strong>Behavioural Sleep Intervention for NHS Shift Workers</strong><br/>
<em>University of Oxford</em><br/>
I’m developing and testing a behavioural intervention tailored to <strong>shift work disorder</strong> in UK NHS healthcare workers. The approach blends circadian-based strategies with behavioral techniques to help individuals adapt to irregular shift schedules, aiming to enhance sleep quality and overall well‑being.</p>

<h3>🌙 Youth Sleep & Chronotype</h3>
<p><strong>CBT‑I with Bright Light Therapy for Eveningness</strong><br/>
<em>University of Hong Kong</em><br/>
I contributed equally to a randomized controlled trial of <strong>cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT‑I)</strong>, with and without <strong>bright light therapy</strong>, targeting youths with insomnia and an evening chronotype. We’re evaluating outcomes on sleep, mood, and objective circadian markers.</p>

<h3>🧠 Cognition & Circadian Disorders in Adolescents</h3>
<p><strong>Cognitive and Behavioral Factors in DSWPD and Insomnia</strong><br/>
<em>University of Hong Kong</em><br/>
This work compares <strong>delayed sleep‑wake phase disorder (DSWPD)</strong> and chronic insomnia in adolescents. We identified shared cognitive-behavioral characteristics — including hyperarousal, maladaptive sleep beliefs, and high sleep reactivity — offering insights into overlapping treatment targets.</p>
