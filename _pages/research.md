My research centres on **behavioral sleep and circadian medicine**, both in terms of mechanisim and interventional reserach into sleep disroders across the lifespan.

### Current Projects

- **Behavioural sleep intervention for NHS shift workers** - _University of Oxford_  
  I’m developing and testing a behavioural intervention tailored to **shift work disorder** in UK NHS healthcare workers. The approach blends circadian-based strategies with behavioral techniques to help individuals adapt to irregular shift schedules, aiming to enhance sleep quality and overall well‑being.

- **CBT‑I combined with bright light therapy for youths with eveningness** - _University of Hong Kong_
  I contributed equally to a study involving a randomized controlled trial of **cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT‑I)**, both alone and in combination with **bright light therapy**, targeting youths experiencing insomnia and evening chronotype. The trial examines effects on insomnia severity, mood, daytime functioning, and objective circadian and sleep measures.

- **Cognitive and behavioral factors in adolescent DSWPD and insomnia** - _University of Hong Kong_
  In work examining **delayed sleep‑wake phase disorder (DSWPD)** versus chronic insomnia in youth, we identified shared cognitive-behavioral characteristics—such as hyperarousal, dysfunctional sleep beliefs, poor sleep hygiene, and sleep reactivity—highlighting vital targets for intervention.
