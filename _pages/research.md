Sleep and circadian rhythms shape nearly every aspect of human health — from mood and cognition to physical, mental, and social health.
My research centres on **behavioral sleep and circadian medicine**, with a focus on mechanisms and interventions for sleep disorders across the lifespan. I work at the intersection of clinical psychology, chronobiology, and public health.

## 🔬 Current Projects

<div class="research-grid">

### 🕒 Shift Work & Circadian Disruption
**Behavioural Sleep Intervention for NHS Shift Workers**  
_University of Oxford_  
I’m developing and testing a behavioural intervention tailored to **shift work disorder** in UK NHS healthcare workers. The approach blends circadian-based strategies with behavioral techniques to help individuals adapt to irregular shift schedules, aiming to enhance sleep quality and overall well‑being.

### 🌙 Youth Sleep & Chronotype
**CBT‑I with Bright Light Therapy for Eveningness**  
_University of Hong Kong_  
I contributed equally to a randomized controlled trial of **cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT‑I)**, with and without **bright light therapy**, targeting youths with insomnia and an evening chronotype. We’re evaluating outcomes on sleep, mood, and objective circadian markers.

### 🧠 Cognition & Circadian Disorders in Adolescents
**Cognitive and Behavioral Factors in DSWPD and Insomnia**  
_University of Hong Kong_  
This work compares **delayed sleep‑wake phase disorder (DSWPD)** and chronic insomnia in adolescents. We identified shared cognitive-behavioral characteristics — including hyperarousal, maladaptive sleep beliefs, and high sleep reactivity — offering insights into overlapping treatment targets.
