## Project Collaboration
I’m always happy to connect with others who share an interest in **sleep**, **mental health**, or more broadly in **clinical/health psychology**. Whether it’s co-authoring a paper, sharing data, or contributing to an interdisciplinary project, I’m open to exploring collaborations that feel like a good fit on both sides. If you're working on something related and want to chat, feel free to reach out! 

## Working with me?
Thank you for your interest! Unfortunately, at the moment I’m not able to supervise students, interns, or independent research projects. As much as I’d love to support more hands-on work, my capacity is limited right now. That said, please feel free to check back in the future — things may change!
