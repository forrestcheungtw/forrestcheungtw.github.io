## Project Collaboration
I’m always happy to connect with others who share an interest in **sleep**, **mental health**, or more broadly in **clinical/health psychology**. Whether it’s co-authoring a paper, sharing data, or contributing to an interdisciplinary project, I’m open to exploring collaborations that feel like a good fit on both sides. If you're working on something related and want to chat, feel free to reach out! 

## Working with me?
Thank you for your interest! Unfortunately, at the moment I’m not able to supervise students, interns, or independent research projects.
