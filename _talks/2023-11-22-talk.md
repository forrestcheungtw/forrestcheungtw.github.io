We were invited by Chong Gene Hang College to give a public sleep education talk for secondary school students. The session focused on why sleep matters and how good habits can make a real difference for health, wellbeing, and school performance.

In the talk, I explained the different stages of sleep and how much sleep young people need, and highlighted common problems among adolescents in Hong Kong such as irregular sleep patterns and late bedtimes. We also looked at the risks of long-term sleep deprivation, including fatigue, reduced concentration, and health difficulties, as well as the influence of circadian rhythms. I finished with some practical tips on improving sleep hygiene and managing stress, espeically during the DSE exam period. The talk was very well received by both students and teachers, who engaged with the discussion and shared their own experiences of sleep in daily life.
