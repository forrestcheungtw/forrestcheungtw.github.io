Together with social worker Jacky Leung, I co-delivered a webinar for lecturers and tutors at the Vocational Training Council. We focused on ways to help young people improve sleep and build resilience.

The talk explored practical approaches to promoting emotional wellbeing, strengthening communication skills, and supporting students with healthy sleep routines. The key takeaway was that teachers can play a vital role in fostering both resilience and healthier sleep in everyday school life.
