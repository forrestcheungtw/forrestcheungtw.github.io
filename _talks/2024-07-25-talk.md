As part of the visit to the Shenzhen People’s Hospital Sleep Medicine Center, invited by Dr Cheng Hanrong, I gave a talk on delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD). 

I covered its diagnostic criteria, assessment methods, and prevalence in adolescents, including our latest data from Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area. I also discussed the overlap between DSWPD and insomnia, from sleep and circadian characteristics to cognitive and behavioural factors, and the challenges this creates for diagnosis and management. The key takeaway was that DSWPD remains under-recognised, and addressing its unique challenges requires both better assessment and tailored interventions.

The talk also sparked some thoughtful discussion on opportunities for future collaboration in this area.
