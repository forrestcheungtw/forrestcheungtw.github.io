I was invited to Haven of Hope Hospital in Hong Kong to give a talk to caregivers on the importance of sleep for their health and wellbeing. The session focused on why sleep matters and how improving sleep habits can make a positive difference in daily life.

In the presentation, we discussed the common problems faced by caregivers, including insufficient sleep, poor sleep quality, and insomnia, and the physical, emotional, and cognitive consequences of long-term sleep deprivation. I shared practical tips on sleep hygiene and stress management, and we considered when medication or professional help might be needed. The talk was warmly received, with many participants reflecting on their own experiences and showing interest in applying the strategies to their daily routines.
