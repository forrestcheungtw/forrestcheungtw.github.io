I was invited by the Occupational Health team from Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust to speak at the NHS Central and Southern Occupational Health Practitionersâ€™ Study Day on the management of shift work disorder.

In my talk, I shared insights from our recent project, focusing on strategies to support NHS staff experiencing sleep difficulties. We discussed how these approaches could be applied in practice and reflected on the real challenges faced by shift workers. The session was well received and encouraged practitioners to think about how small, individualised strategies can make a meaningful difference to sleep health in demanding work environments.
