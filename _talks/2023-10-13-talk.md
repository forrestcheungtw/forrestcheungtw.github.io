At the World Sleep Congress, I was honoured to receive the Young Investigator Award for my oral presentation on our interim findings from a randomised controlled trial of sleep interventions for young people with insomnia and evening chronotype.

In the talk, I shared results comparing Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) alone, CBT-I combined with Bright Light Therapy (BLT), and a waitlist control group. Both active treatments led to improvements in insomnia severity and clinician-rated depressive symptoms, while the CBT-I + BLT group also showed an advance in circadian phase. However, there was no clear added benefit of BLT on insomnia symptoms, and adherence to light therapy was suboptimal. The presentation highlighted the potential value of combining BLT with CBT-I, while also underscoring the importance of long-term evaluation and addressing adherence challenges. The abstract for this presentation is available [here](https://drforrestcheung.com/publications/Cheung_et_al-WS2023-1/).
