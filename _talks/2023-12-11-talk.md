In this symposium, I explored how circadian rhythms contribute to insomnia in young people and how understanding the implications can improve treatment approaches..

I shared evidence on the overlap between eveningness and insomnia, showing how delayed circadian timing and shorter phase angles can worsen sleep quality. We also discussed different subtypes of youth insomnia, including one with circadian-driven patterns unique to young people. The talk highlighted that circadian factors play a central role in youth insomnia, and addressing them directly could lead to better outcomes for young people struggling with sleep difficulties.
