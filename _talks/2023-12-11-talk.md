In this symposium, I explored how circadian rhythms contribute to insomnia in young people.

I shared evidence on the overlap between eveningness and insomnia, showing how delayed circadian timing and shorter phase angles can worsen sleep quality. We also looked at different subtypes of youth insomnia, including one with circadian-driven patterns uniquely presented in young people. The key takeaway was that circadian factors play a central role in youth insomnia, and addressing them directly could improve treatment outcomes.
