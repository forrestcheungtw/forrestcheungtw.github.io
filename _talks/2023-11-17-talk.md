I was invited to deliver a guest lecture as part of the course Introduction to Health Psychology, focusing on the role of sleep as one of the key pillars of human health.

In the lecture, I introduced how sleep interacts with other aspects of health such as physical activity, diet, and mental wellbeing. I also highlighted current evidence on the importance of sleep for both short- and long-term outcomes, and why it deserves equal attention alongside other established health behaviours.
