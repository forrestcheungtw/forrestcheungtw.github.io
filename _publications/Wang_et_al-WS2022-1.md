### Abstract

**Introduction:** The mechanisms underlying sleep disturbances may be related to complex interactions between biological and psychosocial factors. Although previous literature has suggested that personality traits and psychophysiological hyperarousal are implicated in sleep disturbances, the interplay among these factors remained unclear. This study examined the relationship between NEO-Five personality traits and a variety of sleep-related characteristics (i.e. sleep quality, insomnia severity, pre-sleep arousal) and explore the potential mediating effect of pre-sleep arousal on the relationship between personality traits and insomnia.

**Methods:** A total of 120 adults (mean±SD: 29.39±4.52, 71% Female) aged from 25 to 45 years old free of any psychiatric disorder or sleep disorder as ascertained by structured clinical interviews were recruited from the community. All the participants completed the measures of personality traits (NEO Five-Factor Inventory), sleep-related features (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep quality, Insomnia Severity Index for insomnia severity), and cognitive and behavioral pre-sleep arousal as measured by the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale.

**Results:** Linear regression analyses showed that neuroticism was significantly associated with poorer sleep quality (β=0.45, p<.01), more severe insomnia (β=0.47, p<.01), and a higher level of pre-sleep cognitive arousal (β=0.59, p<.01). A higher degree of openness was associated with pre-sleep cognitive arousal (β=0.21, p<.05) while extraversion was found to be negatively associated with sleep quality (β=-0.23, p<.05) and insomnia severity (β=-0.29, p<.01). Mediation analysis revealed that the association between neuroticism and insomnia severity was partially mediated by cognitive arousal before sleep (β=0.07, p<.01).

**Conclusion:** The findings showed the associations of NEO-Five personality traits with sleep quality, insomnia symptoms, and pre-sleep somatic and cognitive arousal among these healthy adults who were free of any sleep or psychiatric problems. In addition, the present study extended the existing literature by showing the interplay between personality traits, which are considered as a predisposing factor, and pre-sleep arousal, which is considered a perpetuating factor, on insomnia. Future longitudinal and interventional studies with objective measures are needed to further explore the mechanism underlying these associations.
