**Abstract**

Adolescence and young adulthood are transitional periods associated with significant changes and challenges, leading to a heightened vulnerability to sleep disturbances and mental health difficulties. This stage is often associated with an increased preference for eveningness, manifested as a later chronotype. The current study aimed to investigate the directionality of the association between chronotype, based on an individual’s sleep–wake behaviour, and insomnia in young people using a two-wave panel design with a 12-month interval. A total of 370 participants aged 15–24 (mean age: 21.0 ± 2.0, 72.7% female) were recruited from local secondary schools and universities. Insomnia symptoms were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index, while chronotype was measured using the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire. Temporal associations were analysed using a series of cross-lagged panel models. The best fitting and most parsimonious model indicated that a later chronotype at baseline predicts more severe insomnia symptoms at the 12-month follow-up after accounting for autoregressive effects. However, the opposite causal model, where baseline insomnia symptoms predicted the chronotype at the 12-month follow-up, was not supported. These findings suggest that a late chronotype may be a potential risk factor for the development of insomnia in young people, emphasising the importance of considering circadian factors in the prevention and treatment of sleep disturbances among this population.
