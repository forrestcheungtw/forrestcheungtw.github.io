  and young adulthood are transitional periods associated with significant
  changes and challenges, leading to a heightened vulnerability to sleep
  disturbances and mental health difficulties. This stage is often associated
  with an increased preference for eveningness, manifested as a later
  chronotype. The current study aimed to investigate the directionality of the
  association between chronotype, based on an individual’s sleep–wake behaviour,
  and insomnia in young people using a two-wave panel design with a 12-month
  interval. A total of 370 participants aged 15–24 (mean age: 21.0 ± 2.0, 72.7%
  female) were recruited from local secondary schools and universities. Insomnia
  symptoms were assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index, while chronotype was
  measured using the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire. Temporal associations were
  analysed using a series of cross-lagged panel models. The best fitting and
  most parsimonious model indicated that a later chronotype at baseline predicts
  more severe insomnia symptoms at the 12-month follow-up after accounting for
  autoregressive effects. However, the opposite causal model, where baseline
  insomnia symptoms predicted the chronotype at the 12-month follow-up, was not
  supported. These findings suggest that a late chronotype may be a potential
  risk factor for the development of insomnia in young people, emphasising the
  importance of considering circadian factors in the prevention and treatment of
  sleep disturbances among this population.
