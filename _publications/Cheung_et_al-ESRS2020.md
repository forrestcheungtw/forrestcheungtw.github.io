### Abstract

**Introduction:** Chronotype, referred to as individual’s diurnal preference of timing for sleep and activities, can be measured using the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ). The MCTQ has the advantage over other questionnaires on circadian typology, such as Horne and Ostberg’s Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), as it differentiates actual sleep and wake time for workdays and free days and uses the midpoint of sleep (MSF) as well as its correction for sleep debt (MSFsc) accumulated over the workdays to estimate chronotype. The current study aimed to validate the Chinese version of MCTQ in the youth population.

**Materials and Methods:** The original MCTQ was translated into Chinese language (C-MCTQ) using translation-back-translation method. Youth participants completed a battery of self-report questionnaires online consisting of the C-MCTQ and MEQ for the measures of circadian preference, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) as a measure of insomnia symptoms, and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) as a measure of depressive symptoms. A subset of sample additionally completed the objective measures of circadian rhythm including actigraphic assessment for seven consecutive days (n = 38) and laboratory-based dim-light melatonin onset assessment (DLMO; n = 17).

**Results:** A total of 612 participants completed the questionnaire measures (age: 20.81 ± 2.0 years, range: 16–24; female: 68%). Test-retest reliability for C-MCTQ was good (intra-class correlation = 0.67–0.82). All parameters of MCTQ (i.e. MSF, MSFsc, midpoint of sleep during workdays (MSW)) were significantly correlated with MEQ score (r = -0.54 to -0.66). MSFsc was 04:12 ± 1:09, 05:21 ± 1:06 and 06:35 ± 1:14 for morning-type, intermediate-type, and evening-type based on MEQ, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). All MCTQ parameters showed higher correlations with actigraphy-based circadian parameters compared to MEQ. DLMO showed a significant association with MSF (r = 0.49, p = 0.04), and marginally significant association with MSFsc (r = 0.45, p = 0.069). In addition, later MSFsc was significantly correlated with higher ISI and PHQ-9 scores.

**Conclusion:** The present study demonstrated that the C-MCTQ could be used as a good clinical tool to reflect an individual’s endogenous circadian timing and is suitable for assessing chronotype with good reliability and validity in Chinese youths.
