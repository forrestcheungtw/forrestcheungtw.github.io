### Abstract
Suicide is the leading cause of death among Hong Kong youths. There has been an increase in student suicide in Hong Kong in recent years. With the high penetration rate of the Internet in Hong Kong, it is imperative to examine the relationship between the new media and youth suicide. Study 1 investigated the role of the new media in youth suicide cases from 2014 to 2016. Study 2 reviewed existing social services (including youth mental health programmes) and their utilisation of the new media. The results revealed that a substantial number of the youths who committed suicide displayed warnings signs on the new media before doing so and that there was a critical lack of social servicesâ€™ presence on the new media. The findings of our studies suggest a need for new intervention programmes, the nature of which we discuss; and we call for the expansion of online social services to meet the counselling needs of youths in Hong Kong.
