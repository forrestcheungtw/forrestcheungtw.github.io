I’ll be in Singapore from 5–10 September for the Asian Society of Sleep Medicine Scientific Meeting and the World Sleep Congress 2025. 

I’m presenting a poster with fresh updates from my current project—developing a behavioural intervention to support shift workers. 
If you’re attending, come say hi! I’m always up for a coffee and a chat about the project (or sleep research in general).
