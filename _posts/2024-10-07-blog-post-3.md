## I am offically starting at Oxford

![](/uploads/news_20241007.jpg)

After a bit of travelling across the UK, I’m offically starting my first day here at Oxford. I’m currently working at the [Experimental and Clinical Sleep Medicine](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/research/experimental-and-clinical-sleep-medicine-group){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"} team at the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute.
