Today marks my **first day** with the [Experimental and Clinical Sleep Medicine Group](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/research/experimental-and-clinical-sleep-medicine-group){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"} at the University of Oxford.

Iâ€™m excited about what lies ahead working alongside world-class researchers on cutting-edge sleep and circadian science. Looking forward to growing, learning, and contributing in this new chapter!
