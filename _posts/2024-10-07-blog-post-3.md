I’ll be in Singapore from 5–10 September for the Asian Society of Sleep Medicine scientific meeting and the World Sleep Congress 2025.

I’ll be presenting a poster with some updates from my current project — developing a behavioural intervention to support shift workers. If you’re attending, feel free to drop by and say hi! Always happy to chat more about the project (or sleep research in general) over coffee.
