I had the pleasure of meeting a group of primary school students visiting the University of Oxford.
In the beautiful cloisters of New College, I shared what it is like to work as a researcher here, from collaborating with a diverse community of scholars to exploring new ideas with some of the brightest minds.
Inspiring to see their curiosity and excitement about sleep science and university life.
